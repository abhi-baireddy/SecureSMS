100 Handshake Attempts and 500 data packets sent

failed_handshakes = 21*
Average Handshake Time = 20.638565519188024 seconds
dropped_or_late_data_packets = 0

*Note - Unsure why handshake attempts failed. Either messages were
dropped, or timeouts occurred. If a timeout occurred, but the message
came in later, it's possible that an old message disrupted the handshake.
This is a vulnerability in the current implementation if Trudy can spoof
messages from Alice or Bob and only desires to disrupt setup of a secure
channel
